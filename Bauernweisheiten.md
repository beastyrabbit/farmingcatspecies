# Bauernweisheiten: Ancient Sayings of the Sun-Marked Farmers

*This standalone chronicle compiles the sacred *Bauernweisheiten* of the Felidae Agricolae, the sun-marked farming cats.
Drawn from their oral traditions and inspired by real-world farmer wisdom (Bauernweisheiten), these 15 exemplary sayings guide daily life, harvest cycles, and spiritual practices.
For each saying, the first bullet lists the real-world origin (a traditional proverb, often from German or European farming folklore; marked as "XXX" if no direct historical match is known).
The second bullet provides the adopted version for the Felidae Agricolae, with a brief explanation tying it to their lore.
