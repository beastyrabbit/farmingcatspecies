# Homes of the Harvest: Housing and Daily Life of the Felidae Agricolae

*This standalone chronicle details the humble abodes and everyday rhythms of the sun-marked farming cats, the Felidae Agricolae.
Blending influences from ancient human farmsteads—such as German timber-framed houses with mud walls for insulation and Japanese elements like simple, open layouts—their homes reflect a life intertwined with soil, seasons, and spirits.
As with all aspects of their society, these dwellings honor the *Bauernweisheiten*, ensuring harmony with the earth. (For governance and rare urban centers, see rules.md and cities.md.)*

## A Dawn in the Mud-Walled Den

In the dim light of pre-dawn, Elder Whiskerroot stirred in the corner nest of woven straw, his muted green-brown stripes faintly visible on his carrot-marked fur.
The single large room of the home—framed in sturdy oak wood, walls packed with mud and lime-washed white for cool summers and warm winters—hummed with the soft breaths of his multi-generational clan.
His daughter, a young queen with soil-brown legs, lit the central fire under the metal cooking blade, its brick hearth simple yet enduring. "Morgenstund hat Gold im Mund," Whiskerroot murmured, invoking the ancient wisdom as he padded outside to scan the sky for signs of a fruitful day.
The family gathered around the low wooden table for a breakfast of bartered oats and fresh carrots, before the toms headed to the fields, leaving the queens to tend kittens and lighter chores. By evening, smoke curled from the ceiling vent, carrying tales of the day's labor into the harvest moon.

## Explanations of Homestead Design

The homes of the Felidae Agricolae are practical sanctuaries, designed for communal living and tied to their agricultural souls.
Built with a wooden frame inspired by German Fachwerk (timber framing) and Japanese minka (folk houses) for open, flexible spaces, the walls are filled with mud daub and coated in white lime plaster—a European tradition for brightness and pest resistance, echoed in Japanese whitewashed interiors for cleanliness. This keeps the interior temperature steady, shielding against rolling hill winds.

- **Layout and Interior**: Each home is essentially one vast room, subtly sectioned by woven reed screens (a nod to Japanese shoji dividers).
The central gathering spot features a low table for meals and storytelling, surrounded by a brick hearth with a flat metal blade over the fire—used for direct cooking or heating pots of stew.
  Sleeping nests of straw and fur-lined blankets tuck into corners, while tools and seeds store in alcoves. No separate kitchens exist, as all life revolves around the communal fire, whose smoke escapes via a small ceiling opening.

- **Crop-Specific Touches**: Decorations draw from medieval harvest crafts, honoring the cats' fur patterns. Carrot clans hang braided root bundles over doors like protective talismans; apple farmers carve wooden fruit motifs into beams, mimicking bark textures; broccoli growers dot walls with speckled patterns from grey-brown clay; mushroom cultivators favor misty-grey washes on lime plaster; berry homes might gain faint red-tinged roofs if mastery allows, evoking mythical fur tips; but most abodes remain unmodded, often called "boring" but sturdy.

- **Location and Community**: Houses cluster loosely along rivers or springs for water access, scattered randomly rather than in tight villages—some solitary, others forming mini-settlements of 2-5 homes (akin to German Aussiedlerhöfe). Over generations, natural hubs emerge where paths converge, fostering communal spots for Elders' Circles. Life inside is chaotic and multi-generational, with elders, adults, and kittens sharing space; friends and wanderers often visit, swapping tales and bartered goods.

## An Evening Among the Berry Clans

As the sun dipped, painting the berry farmer's home in reddish hues that matched the faint tips on matriarch Berrywhisk's fur, the clan returned from the vines. The single-room dwelling, its lime-white walls adorned with white-dotted berry wreaths (inspired by medieval fruit garlands for abundance), buzzed with activity. Toms shared stories of distant fields learned during *Wanderjahr*, while queens prepared supper on the hearth's metal blade— a stew of home-grown raspberries mixed with traded mushrooms, eaten directly from shared bowls around the central fire. Kittens played near the elders, who recited *Bauernweisheiten* like "You reap what you sow," teaching patience as faint patterns emerged on tiny white coats. Repairs to a mud wall crack, caused by recent rains, waited for the post-harvest season, a quick patch of straw holding for now. Under the harvest moon, the family nestled into corners, the day's rhythm complete—work for toms in the fields, lighter tending and child-rearing for queens, all in harmony with the earth's cycle.

## Additional Definitions and Explanations

Daily life follows medieval rhythms, adapted to the Warrior Cats universe where felines live as skilled farmers without human tools but with instinctive craftsmanship. Families rise at dawn; the lead cat checks weather per *Bauernweisheiten* like "Der Bauer hört das Gras wachsen" (attuning to nature's whispers), ensuring a good day for planting. Breakfast is communal, featuring home-produced foods—carrots for one clan, apples for another—with bartering adding variety, like trading berries for grains.

Work splits traditionally: toms handle heavy fieldwork from sunrise, while queens manage lighter tasks, kitten care, and home upkeep, fostering innovation when wanderers bring new methods. Elders contribute by teaching young ones, their elaborate face masks symbols of wisdom shared over evening meals. Leisure involves storytelling or crafting decorations, always tied to seasons—intense in planting, restful in winter.

Maintenance is seasonal: quick fixes with straw or mud hold until harvest's end, when clans repair together, invoking spirits for durability. Rare true towns with smiths for tools or crop markets exist far apart, but these are hubs of trade, not daily life (detailed in cities.md). Outcasts and the ruling family dwell differently—the former in makeshift shelters, the latter in opulent estates (to be described separately). In all, these homes embody the *Bauernweisheiten*: simple, enduring, and ever-marked by the sun's grace.
